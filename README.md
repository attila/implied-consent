implied-consent.js
===============

An implied consent notice to comply with the UK's implementation of the EU cookie laws (Note: this is not guaranteed to protect you!)

It should work with a responsively designed site to adapt to mobile devices, or on a fixed-width site it'll stay fixed width.

Installation / Usage
------------
Upload the minified JS file to your CDN or web host of choice, change the path to your privacy policy, and then stick this in the footer of your site. 
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.example.com/path/to/implied-consent.min.js"></script>

Do not include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...). The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.
