implied-consent.js
===============

An implied consent notice to comply with the UK's implementation of the EU cookie laws (Note: this is not guaranteed to protect you!)

It should work with a responsively designed site to adapt to mobile devices, or on a fixed-width site it'll stay fixed width.

Instructions
------------
Upload the minified JS file to your CDN or web host of choice, change the path to your privacy policy, and then stick this in the footer of your site.
