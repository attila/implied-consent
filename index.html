<p>An implied consent notice to comply with the UK's implementation of the EU cookie laws (Note: this is not guaranteed to protect you!)</p>

<p>It should work with a responsively designed site to adapt to mobile devices, or on a fixed-width site it'll stay fixed width.</p>

<h2>Installation / Usage</h2>

<p>Upload the minified JS file to your CDN or web host of choice, change the path to your privacy policy, and then stick this in the footer of your site. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.example.com/path/to/implied-consent.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Do not include the script directly from GitHub (<a href="http://raw.github.com/...">http://raw.github.com/...</a>). The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.</p>
